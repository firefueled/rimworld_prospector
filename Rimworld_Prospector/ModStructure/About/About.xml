    Prospectin' like any distinguished old hand would.

    This make miners a little smarter, turning them into distinguished prospectors.

    Currently, the only thing they do is spot valuable rocks that haven't been marked for mining, and do so. In this way, the prospector should mine a whole vein by simply marking the surface-visible ores, reducing micro-managing.
    You can also trace a line through a whole mountain and the prospector will mine any veins they encounter on the way.

    In the future, they plan to use accompanying mules to store mined ores and have them dump the ores back at the home.
